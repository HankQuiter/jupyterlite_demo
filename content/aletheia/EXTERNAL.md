### External resources

Aletheia utilizes external software sourced from various repositories and 
projects. Due to license incompatibilities with Aletheia's MIT license, these 
components are not directly included in our main repository. As a result, we 
have moved all such software to an external repository 
'[aletheia-external-resources](https://github.com/daniellerch/aletheia-external-resources)'. 

Whenever any of these components are used, the corresponding license is presented 
to the user for review and acceptance. This approach ensures adherence to 
licensing regulations and maintains transparency in the use of third-party 
software. It allows us to efficiently integrate diverse tools and technologies 
while respecting the copyrights and legal conditions set by their creators, 
all within the framework of Aletheia's MIT license compatibility
